# Exercise - SQL 64

## Setup

If you are using a Mac, you can use the terminal command `createdb n64` to create a database, and then use command `psql -d n64` to enter the database, and you can continue this assignment from there.

If you are using a PC, use the SQL shell, and enter the command `CREATE DATABASE n64;` to create a database, then use command `\c n64` to enter the database, and you can continue this assignment from there.

Take the following schema for an N64 SQL database

```SQL
 CREATE TABLE Games (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   title VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
   year INTEGER NOT NULL,
   developers VARCHAR (50),
   genre VARCHAR (50)
 );
```

Once you do that, you should be able to enter the following lines one by one

```SQL
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time', 1998, 'Nintendo EAD', 'Action-Adventure');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Super Smash Bros.', 1999, 'Hal Laboratory', 'Fighting');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Super Mario 64', 1996, 'Nintendo EAD', 'Platforming');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Golden Eye 007', 1997, 'Rare', 'First-Person Shooter');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Mario Kart 64', 1996, 'Nintendo EAD', 'Racing');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Star Fox 64', 1997, 'Nintendo EAD', 'Rail/Scrolling Shooter');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Perfect Dark', 2000, 'Rare', 'First-Person Shooter');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Star Wars: Shadow of the Empire', 1996, 'Lucas Arts', 'Action');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Banjo-Kazooie', 1998, 'Rare', 'Platforming');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Mario Party', 1998, 'Hudson Soft', 'Party Game');
INSERT INTO Games(title, year, developers, genre) VALUES('Tony Hawk''s Pro Skater' , 1996, 'Neversoft', 'Extreme Sports');
```
